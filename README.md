## Tasks performed by the gokart.c program
* Reading state of the gas pedal
* Reading state of the braking pedal
* Generating PWM waveforms for controlling electric motors
* Allowing smooth control of motors power from 0 to 100%
* Making the go-kart to decelerate slowly in case of quick release of the gas pedal
# Gun Chronograph
## Tasks performed by the chrono.c program
* Precise time measuring between triggering photocells by a bullet
* Calculating bullet's speed from known distance and time
* Displaying calculated speed on 8-segment displays in multiplex mode
